# Vedant Agarwal's Digital Playground 👋

Hey there! I’m Vedant Agarwal, a senior at UC Berkeley tackling **Applied Math** and **Physics** with a side of existential pondering. When I’m not debugging equations or daydreaming about the universe, I’m diving into philosophy, messing with investment ideas, or tweeting my overthoughts. This GitHub is my creative sandbox—where code meets curiosity. Check out my [personal blog](https://vedantagarwal.xyz/) for my latest rants on Berkeley life, chaos theory, and why I’m still broke despite my stock picks!

## Who Am I?
- 🎓 **Student**: UC Berkeley, Class of 2025, Applied Math & Physics.
- 🤔 **Interests**: Philosophy (what’s it all for?), investing (can I beat the market?), and quantum weirdness.
- 💻 **Vibe**: Part coder, part thinker, all chill. I’m not here to win awards—just to explore and build.
- 🌐 **Online**: Follow my tweets @V_Agarwal1 or dive into my blog for the full story.

## What’s Here?
This repo is the beating heart of my projects, blending my nerdy passions with a dash of fun. Expect a mix of:
- **Software Engineering**: Practical tools and games showcasing my coding skills.
- **AI/ML**: Models tackling data, from stock trends to tweet vibes.
- **Physics & Quantum Computing**: Simulations and experiments inspired by my studies.

I’m gearing up for SWE internships, AI/ML roles, and research gigs—stay tuned as I crank out more code!

### Current & Upcoming Projects
- **Markdown Blog Generator**: A tool to jazz up my blog posts at vedantagarwal.xyz (because even philosophers need style).
- **Stock Price Predictor with LSTM**: An AI play to predict market chaos (not financial advice—just math!).
- **Quantum Circuit Simulator**: Tinkering with qubits to mimic the universe’s quirks.
- **CLI Physics Game**: A text-based shooter with a homemade physics engine—nerd therapy in code.

(Psst: I’ll pin my best ones soon—watch this space!)

## Get Involved
- 🌟 **Star** this repo if you vibe with it!
- 💬 **Feedback**: Got thoughts? Hit me up via [vedantagarwal.xyz](https://vedantagarwal.xyz/) or @V_Agarwal1.
- 🔧 **Contribute**: Fork it, tweak it, PR it—I’m all about collaborative chaos.



## Let’s Connect

Thanks for dropping by! This is just the start—expect more projects, reflections, and maybe a few bad puns as I navigate Berkeley, code, and the meaning of it all. Let’s build something wild together! 🚀
